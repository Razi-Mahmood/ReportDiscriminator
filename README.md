# ReportDiscriminator
This project contains code to build the report discriminator. 

The dataset of images is too big to put on github. 
You can download from Kaggle at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university?select=images

The ground truth list of reports are at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university?select=indiana_reports.csv

The cell setting the image directory and dataset may have to be customized for wherever you are storing the images as those should not be part of github uploads or downloads

If you would like use this code for your projects or the datasets here, please cite our paper
"Fact Checking of AI-generated Radiology Reports" in MLMI 2023 also enclosed in the paper directory here.
