# ReportDiscriminator
This project contains code to build the report discriminator. 

The dataset of images is too big to put on github. 
You can download from Kaggle at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university?select=images

The ground truth list of reports are at:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raddar/chest-xrays-indiana-university?select=indiana_reports.csv

The cell setting the image directory and dataset may have to be customized for wherever you are storing the images as those should not be part of github uploads or downloads
